# Implement-SLAM-with-RGBD-measurements



Implement simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using odometry,  inertial,  2-D laser
range, and RGBD measurements from a humanoid robot. Use the IMU, odometry, and laser measurements
to localize the robot and build a 2-D occupancy grid map of the environment.  Use the RGBD information
to color the floor of your 2-D map.
